    The article I read comes from this link: https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/01/02/advice-for-computer-science-college-students/. 

### My thoughts on this article

    This article is written by Joel Spolsky, a software developer in NYC. In this article, he gives advices to computer science major students for them to better succeed in their future career. The reason why it interest me is because that he covered a few points which I, as a computer science major student, did not think of when I was planning my study. For example, he mentioned it's better to learn C before graduating as C is the language close to the machine, and it helps you write better code in other languages. I never thought of that. I thought getting proficient in some high level language like java and javascript is very much good enough. He also says it's better to learn microeconomics (which I did) for it will make a pragrammer more valueable for a business. All those are good advices. 

## Comments: 

    Steve Hai: Yep, I agree with this article, especially on its point about not negleting non-CS classes. In an era where all sorts of job could potentially be replaced by AI, having an all-rounded skillset and mindset would definitely help competing with those automated systems.
